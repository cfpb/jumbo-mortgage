# jumbo-mortgage [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/cfpb/jumbo-mortgage.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/cfpb/jumbo-mortgage)

> Tells you if a loan is "jumbo".

**Note:** Loan limits [increased in 2017](https://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Pages/FHFA-Announces-Increase-in-Maximum-Conforming-Loan-Limits-for-Fannie-Mae-and-Freddie-Mac-in-2017.aspx). Use v1.x.x of this module if you want 2016 limits. Use v2.x.x for 2017 limits.
